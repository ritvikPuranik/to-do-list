## Features-
1. Add Task - Takes the user prompt and adds a task into the smart contract
2. Refresh Tasks - Reads the tasks from the smart contract and renders onto the UI
3. Complete Task - When a task is checked on the UI, a transaction is made with the smart contract to update status of the task. This task will then show up as per the ststus on the UI

The smart contract code is deployed on local blockchain(ganache) and coded on remix for the time-being. The abi and contract address are used to instantiate the contract
